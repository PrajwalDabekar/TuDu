The Todo application is developed using ReactJS, incorporating the Context API, a state management feature, to efficiently manage and propagate task-related data across various components within the application. The Context API facilitates the centralized storage and accessibility of task-related information, allowing seamless access and modification across the app's components without the need for prop drilling.

Furthermore, the application leverages local storage, a browser-based storage mechanism, to persistently store the user's tasks. By utilizing the local storage capabilities, the app ensures the preservation of tasks even after the user closes or refreshes the browser, enabling a seamless and persistent user experience.

This combination of the Context API and local storage optimizes the app's performance and user experience by efficiently managing task data flow and ensuring data persistence across sessions.
